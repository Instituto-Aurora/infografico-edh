    "description": "To outline the overview of Human Rights Education (HRE) in Brazil, the research was divided into two stages. In the first stage, we sought to understand the institutionalization of HRE at the federal level, using information from the ministries responsible for HRE. In the second stage, we analyzed the Brazilian states to assess the extent to which HRE is institutionalized in each location. Data were collected biennially (2019–2020, 2021–2022, 2023–2024, and so on). The research was conducted through interviews and information obtained from official websites, emails, phone calls, and freedom of information requests — in accordance with Law No. 12.527/11. For detailed data on each state,",
